1. Handle LATE and unclosed scheduled transactions by bubbling forward etc.

2. New-transaction widget

3. Burn rate computation and graph

4. Check these discrepancies:
    - savings was showing ~$1000 when it should have been showing ~700

    - displayed balance in checking was off from graph balance in checking

Minor:

- show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff

- way to correct errors in the database - i.e. when something gets marked PAID
  but google calendar never saw it

- enforce that updates must be successfully received by google calendar before
  any related database transactions are modified
