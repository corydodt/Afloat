1. Burn rate computation and graph

Minor:
    
- check PAID status on intervening days if a transaction is being moved

- fix all places where recurrence should be checked and broken - test with
  recurring events.
    This should be relatively easy for marking things PAID.  
    - get the recurring event as oldEvent
    - create a new event, with originalEvent = oldEvent
    - Make the originalEvent have a <when>start_time of the instance you're
      altering
    - Edit, then publish the new event containing originalEvent==oldEvent.
    Q: How do I move (for bubbling/reschedule) or remove (for unscheduling)?
     .. looks like i need to set status=canceled and filter out canceled
        events when removing.  Reschedule should just be setting a new
        startTime on the containing event.
- Amounts of the form $-99 are parsed incorrectly: interpreted as DEPOSITS
  when they come at the beginning of a line in the scheduler widget

- scheduler table sometimes gets off by a few pixels and floats down to the
  next line

- fix caching of javascript and images from static.. max-age=0??

- show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff
