2  the lightbox appears *behind* flash plugin objects (workaround/hack: make
   the flash object visibility: hidden until after lightbox?)
    - test: a) schedule a random txn to happen 4? days ago using the Google UI
      b) force an update so the lightbox appears
    - actual: the lightbox content appears partially behind the flash object,
      or is garbled (observed in FF OSX)
    - expected: the lightbox's content is clearly visible without artifacts.
      The flash chart need not be visible.

3  Amounts of the form $-99 are parsed incorrectly: interpreted as DEPOSITS
   when they come at the beginning of a line in the scheduler widget
    - test: a) schedule an event as $-99 foo bar using the scheduler. an
      update will happen automatically.
    - actual: The event should show as a debit of $-99 in the schedule box
    - expected: The event shows as a deposit of $99

4  show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff

5  fix caching of javascript and images from static.. max-age=0??

6  Hyperlink from events to the google calendar entry, so you can edit them.
   Instances of recurring events should have an extra HL to edit the original

7  speed up fixup step by doing all fixups in one request

8  Do not show the None hold in the UI when hovering

9  scheduler table sometimes gets off by a few pixels and floats down to the
   next line
