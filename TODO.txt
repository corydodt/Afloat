1. Burn rate computation and graph

Minor:

- items scheduled with quick add are being added to today even if they are for
  some other day of the week or day of the month
    - test: if today is Tuesday, schedule "foo $-24 every wednesday"
    - expected an event scheduled for tomorrow and a week from tomorrow in the
      schedule
    - actual: event is scheduled for tomorrow and a week from tomorrow, but
      also one for today.
    
- When the bank request fails, transactions are bubbled forward automatically
  anyway.  This means sometimes transactions are moved away from the date when
  they were actually paid.
    - test: a) schedule a txn that occurred today, on today  b) tamper with
      /etc/hosts so that the bank ofx request fails  c) start server and do
      matchup
    - actual: the txn that occurred today is moved to tomorrow.  Now it can no
      longer be reconciled automatically, even though it did occur.
    - expected: ?? maybe set a global (fs?) lock on the matchup process when ofx
      begins.  don't remove the lock until ofx succeeds.

- check PAID status on intervening days if a transaction is being moved

- the lightbox appears *behind* flash plugin objects (workaround/hack:
    make the flash object visibility: hidden until after lightbox?)

- Amounts of the form $-99 are parsed incorrectly: interpreted as DEPOSITS
  when they come at the beginning of a line in the scheduler widget

- fix caching of javascript and images from static.. max-age=0??

- Hyperlink from events to the google calendar entry, so you can edit them.
  Instances of recurring events should have an extra HL to edit the original

- speed up fixup step by doing all fixups in one request

- events scheduled for yesterday are bubbled forward before marking things
  PAID, then the thing doesn't get marked PAID because it's on the wrong day
    - test: find any txn that occurred yesterday
    - in google ui, schedule a transaction for it on the day it actually paid
    - force update in afloat.  event SHOULD be scheduled to yesterday, marked
      paid.  instead it is scheduled to today, not paid.

- scheduler table sometimes gets off by a few pixels and floats down to the
  next line

- show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff
