1. Burn rate computation and graph

Minor:

- scheduler table sometimes gets off by a few pixels and floats down to the
  next line

- flag transactions as late even when they are new, as they come back.
  Reproduce: 1. Use scheduler widget to add a new event, 2 weeks ago  2.
  When page refreshes, I should immediately get the late transactions dialog.
    Instead I get the normal page, with no hint of the late transaction.

- match up transactions even when they are new, as they come back.
  Reproduce: 1. Find a ledger transaction for today  2. Schedule a transaction
    for it in the scheduler  3. When page refreshes, I should immediately see
    it marked PAID On the bubble.  Instead it still shows 'pending'

- Amounts of the form $-99 are parsed incorrectly: interpreted as DEPOSITS
  when they come at the beginning of a line in the scheduler widget

- when an item lands on the financial calendar with no amount, getGvents
  throws an exception. Reproduce: 1. Use google directly to add an item with
    no numbers  2. restart server so getGvents gets called  3. observe, an
    exception.
    
- way to correct errors in the database - i.e. when something gets marked PAID
  but google calendar never saw it (does this still happen?
    importScheduledTransaction does some of this now..)

- fix caching of javascript and images from static.. max-age=0??

- fix all places where recurrence should be checked and broken - test with
  recurring events

- show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff
