1. Handle LATE transactions in the UI

2. Burn rate computation and graph

Minor:

- show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff

- way to correct errors in the database - i.e. when something gets marked PAID
  but google calendar never saw it

- enforce that updates must be successfully received by google calendar before
  any related database transactions are modified

- Amounts of the form $-999 are interpreted as DEPOSITS when they come at the
  beginning of a line in the scheduler widget

- fix all places where recurrence should be checked and broken - test with
  recurring events

- flag transactions as late even when they are new, as they come back

- stop using DeanEdwards

- pressing 'enter' on the page with nothing typed into the scheduler area
  causes NoAmountError

- when an item lands on the financial calendar with no amount, getGvents
  throws an exception
