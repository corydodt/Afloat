1. Burn rate computation and graph

Minor:
    
- Txns scheduled within 1 day of the far edge of the bubble do not show up in
  the scheduler or on the graph (off-by-1?)

- check PAID status on intervening days if a transaction is being moved

- the lightbox appears *behind* flash plugin objects (workaround/hack:
    make the flash object visibility: hidden until after lightbox?)

- Amounts of the form $-99 are parsed incorrectly: interpreted as DEPOSITS
  when they come at the beginning of a line in the scheduler widget

- scheduler table sometimes gets off by a few pixels and floats down to the
  next line

- fix caching of javascript and images from static.. max-age=0??

- show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff

- Hyperlink from events to the google calendar entry, so you can edit them.
  Instances of recurring events should have an extra HL to edit the original

- speed up fixup step by doing all fixups in one request

- events scheduled for yesterday are bubbled forward before marking things
  PAID, then the thing doesn't get marked PAID because it's on the wrong day
    - test: find any txn that occurred yesterday
    - in google ui, schedule a transaction for it on the day it actually paid
    - force update in afloat.  event SHOULD be scheduled to yesterday, marked
      paid.  instead it is scheduled to today, not paid.

- items scheduled with quick add are being added to today even if they are for
  some other day of the week or day of the month
    - test: if today is Tuesday, schedule "foo $-24 every wednesday"
    - expected an event scheduled for tomorrow and a week from tomorrow in the
      schedule
    - actual: event is scheduled for tomorrow and a week from tomorrow, but
      also one for today.
