1. Handle LATE and unclosed scheduled transactions by bubbling forward etc.

2. Burn rate computation and graph

Minor:

- show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff

- way to correct errors in the database - i.e. when something gets marked PAID
  but google calendar never saw it

- enforce that updates must be successfully received by google calendar before
  any related database transactions are modified
 
- in On the Bubble, insert a blank row for every Monday

- put a spinner over the scheduler input when adding a new transaction that way

- button to delete txns from the bubble
