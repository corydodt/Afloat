1. Burn rate computation and graph

Minor
=====

1  When the bank request fails, transactions are bubbled forward automatically
   anyway.  This means sometimes transactions are moved away from the date when
   they were actually paid.
    - test: a) schedule a txn that occurred today, on today  b) tamper with
      /etc/hosts so that the bank ofx request fails  c) start server and do
      matchup
    - actual: the txn that occurred today is moved to tomorrow.  Now it can no
      longer be reconciled automatically, even though it did occur.
    - expected: ?? maybe set a global (fs?) lock on the matchup process when ofx
      begins.  don't remove the lock until ofx succeeds.

2  the lightbox appears *behind* flash plugin objects (workaround/hack:
   make the flash object visibility: hidden until after lightbox?)
    - test: a) schedule a random txn to happen 4? days ago using the Google UI
      b) force an update so the lightbox appears
    - actual: the lightbox content appears partially behind the flash object,
      or is garbled (observed in FF OSX)
    - expected: the lightbox's content is clearly visible without artifacts.
      The flash chart need not be visible.

3  Amounts of the form $-99 are parsed incorrectly: interpreted as DEPOSITS
   when they come at the beginning of a line in the scheduler widget
    - test: a) schedule an event as $-99 foo bar using the scheduler. an
      update will happen automatically.
    - actual: The event should show as a debit of $-99 in the schedule box
    - expected: The event shows as a deposit of $99

4  check PAID status on intervening days if a transaction is being moved

5  show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff

6  fix caching of javascript and images from static.. max-age=0??

7  Hyperlink from events to the google calendar entry, so you can edit them.
   Instances of recurring events should have an extra HL to edit the original

8  speed up fixup step by doing all fixups in one request

9  scheduler table sometimes gets off by a few pixels and floats down to the
   next line
