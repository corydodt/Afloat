1. Burn rate computation and graph

Minor
=====

1  Amounts of the form $-99 are parsed incorrectly: interpreted as DEPOSITS
   when they come at the beginning of a line in the scheduler widget
    - test: a) schedule an event as $-99 foo bar using the scheduler. an
      update will happen automatically.
    - actual: The event should show as a debit of $-99 in the schedule box
    - expected: The event shows as a deposit of $99

2  show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff

3  Do not show the None hold in the UI when hovering

4  fix caching of javascript and images from static.. max-age=0??

5  Hyperlink from events to the google calendar entry, so you can edit them.
   Instances of recurring events should have an extra HL to edit the original

6  speed up fixup step by doing all fixups in one request

7  scheduler table sometimes gets off by a few pixels and floats down to the
   next line
