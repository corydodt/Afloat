1. Burn rate computation and graph

Minor:
    
- fix all places where recurrence should be checked and broken - test with
  recurring events.

- Txns scheduled within 1 day of the far edge of the bubble do not show up in
  the scheduler or on the graph (off-by-1?)

- check PAID status on intervening days if a transaction is being moved

- the lightbox appears *behind* flash plugin objects (workaround/hack:
    make the flash object visibility: hidden until after lightbox?)

- Amounts of the form $-99 are parsed incorrectly: interpreted as DEPOSITS
  when they come at the beginning of a line in the scheduler widget

- scheduler table sometimes gets off by a few pixels and floats down to the
  next line

- fix caching of javascript and images from static.. max-age=0??

- show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff

- Hyperlink from events to the google calendar entry, so you can edit them.
  Instances of recurring events should have an extra HL to edit the original

- speed up fixup step by doing all fixups in one request
