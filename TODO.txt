1. Burn rate computation and graph

Minor:
    
- fix all places where recurrence should be checked and broken - test with
  recurring events

- Amounts of the form $-99 are parsed incorrectly: interpreted as DEPOSITS
  when they come at the beginning of a line in the scheduler widget

- scheduler table sometimes gets off by a few pixels and floats down to the
  next line

- way to correct errors in the database - i.e. when something gets marked PAID
  but google calendar never saw it (does this still happen?
    importScheduledTransaction does some of this now..)

- fix caching of javascript and images from static.. max-age=0??

- show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff
