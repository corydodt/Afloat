1. Handle LATE transactions in the UI

2. Burn rate computation and graph

Minor:

- link to call getGvents manually (for testing)

- show future debits from savings / clean up defaultAccount stuff

- way to correct errors in the database - i.e. when something gets marked PAID
  but google calendar never saw it (does this still happen?
    importScheduledTransaction does some of this now..)

- enforce that updates must be successfully received by google calendar before
  any related database transactions are modified (does this still happen? 
    check each call to protocol.something and see if related database commits
    happen only after success)

- Amounts of the form $-99 are parsed incorrectly: interpreted as DEPOSITS
  when they come at the beginning of a line in the scheduler widget

- fix all places where recurrence should be checked and broken - test with
  recurring events

- flag transactions as late even when they are new, as they come back.
  Reproduce: 1. Use scheduler widget to add a new event, 2 weeks ago  2.
  When page refreshes, I should immediately get the late transactions dialog.
    Instead I get the normal page, with no hint of the late transaction.

- when an item lands on the financial calendar with no amount, getGvents
  throws an exception. Reproduce: 1. Use google directly to add an item with
    no numbers  2. restart server so getGvents gets called 3.  observe, an
    exception.
    
- fix caching of javascript and images from static.. max-age=0??
